Predicted Errors
Based on the analysis, the program will not execute successfully. Below are the specific issues:

IndentationError:

Misaligned global shared_list and function definitions will cause a SyntaxError.
NameError:

threads is referenced incorrectly in the second part of the code.
Circular Await:

await main() within main creates a RecursionError.
Runtime Errors:

Race conditions in shared_list modification.
Potential ZeroDivisionError if shared_list becomes empty.


CORRECTED VERSION OF CODE:
import asyncio
import threading

shared_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]

def blocking_sum():
    global shared_list
    total = sum(shared_list)
    print(f"Blocking Sum: {shared_list} is {total}")
    shared_list.append(total)

async def async_average():
    global shared_list
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
    if not shared_list:
        print("Async Error: No numbers provided.")
    else:
        avg = sum(shared_list) / len(shared_list)
        print(f"Async Average: {shared_list} is {avg}")

async def main():
    global shared_list
    thread = threading.Thread(target=blocking_sum)
    thread.start()
    shared_list = [50, 60, 70]  # Modifying shared_list during thread execution
    await async_average()
    thread.join()

asyncio.run(main())

# Part 2: Currency Conversion Tracker
total_conversions = 0

def currency_conversion_tracker(amount, rate):
    global total_conversions
    try:
        if rate <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Exchange rate must be positive.")
        converted = amount * rate
        print(f"Converted {amount} at rate {rate} is {converted}")
        total_conversions += converted
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

amounts = [60, 120, 180, 240]
rates = [1, -0.5, 0, 1.5]

threads = [
    threading.Thread(target=currency_conversion_tracker, args=(amt, rate))
    for amt, rate in zip(amounts, rates)
]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print("Final total conversions:", total_conversions)


OUTPUT:
Blocking Sum: [10, 20, 30, 40] is 100
Async Average: [50, 60, 70] is 60.0
_________________________________________

Converted 60 at rate 1 is 60
Error: Exchange rate must be positive.
Error: Exchange rate must be positive.
Converted 240 at rate 1.5 is 360
Final total conversions: 420
